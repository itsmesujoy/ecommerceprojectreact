            <p>An e-commerce website is one that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service.

                It’s tough to imagine daily life without e-commerce. We order food, clothes, and furniture; we register for classes and other online services; we download books, music, and movies; and so much more. E-commerce has taken root and is here to stay.

                The term “e-commerce” simply means the sale of goods or services on the internet. In its most basic form, e-commerce involves electronically transferring funds and data between 2 or more parties. This form of business has evolved quite a bit since its beginnings in the electronic data interchange of the 1960s and the inception of online shopping in the 1990s.

                In recent years, e-commerce has enjoyed a massive boost from the rise of smartphones, which allow consumers to shop from nearly anywhere.</p>

                E-commerce sites are also a popular way to sell services, like consultations, maintenance, tutoring, lessons, and more. Whether you want to learn to code a website or you’re looking for an experienced trainer to help fix your dog’s troublesome barking habit, there’s no shortage of assistance available online.

                Digital products

                Digital products—like online courses, software, podcasts, music, and e-books—are becoming increasingly popular on e-commerce sites as well. The rise of digital products has opened up a new way to learn skills on demand.

                When it comes to selling goods and services online, there are a few basic functions every e-commerce site should include.

                Accept orders
                If you’re running a business that sells a product, your e-commerce site must be able to accept orders from your customers. This process can be more complex than you might expect. For each order, your site will need to:

                Record customer information (name, address, etc.)
                Collect customers’ acceptance of your terms of service
                Calculate any applicable taxes
                Apply coupons or discounts
                Generate order and tracking numbers
                Share delivery details
                Process billing information
                Provide access to a payment gateway
                Take payments
                There should be a seamless transition from your website to a payment gateway. Typically, payment gateways allow customers to:

                Select a payment option
                Provide details such as credit card numbers and CVVs
                Use multi-step authentication for secure payments
                Handle shipping and logistics
                Once your site has handled the order and payment process for a customer, the next step is delivery.

                As a seller, your goal is to ensure that customers receive the right product on time and in perfect condition. To help this process along, you can either handle shipping and logistics yourself or use a third-party provider. No matter which method you choose, your website should be able to initiate the process accurately and consistently.

                Your site will also need to have a process in place for accepting returned items. Also known as reverse logistics, this process is just as important as shipping outbound goods.
